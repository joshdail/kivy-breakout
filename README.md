# kivy-breakout
A basic breakout clone built with Python 3.9 and Kivy

## Version 1.0.0

This is a small project I coded to familarize myself with Kivy.

Controls are simple. Press the space bar to start the game. To move the paddle, you can use the left and right arrows or click and drag with your mouse/touchpad.

There are still several improvements to make, including increasing the speed of the ball, some sort of score or life system, etc.
